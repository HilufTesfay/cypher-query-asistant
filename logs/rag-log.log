2025-09-05 09:49:50,629 - __main__ - INFO - Response: There are no students listed in the database with Electrical Engineering as their major.  This could be due to a few reasons:

* **No students with that major exist in the database:**  It's possible that no one has declared Electrical Engineering as their major yet, or that the information hasn't been added to the system.
* **Incorrect spelling or capitalization:** Double-check that "Electrical Engineering" is entered exactly as it's stored in the database (including capitalization).  A slight difference could prevent a match.
* **Data entry error:** There might be a mistake in how the major information was entered for students.

If you're certain students with this major should be in the database, please check the data source for accuracy.

2025-09-05 09:52:33,342 - __main__ - INFO - Response: There are no students listed in the database as majoring in Electrical Engineering.  This could be due to a few reasons:

* **No students with that major exist in the database:**  It's possible that no one has yet declared this major, or that the data hasn't been updated to reflect current student information.
* **Incorrect data entry:** There might be a typo in the "Electrical Engineering" major name within the database, or the student records might have incorrect major information.
* **Data is incomplete:** The database may only contain a subset of student information, and the records for Electrical Engineering students are missing.
* **The query itself might be incorrect:** While unlikely, it's possible there's a problem with how the query was structured, preventing it from finding the correct data.


To help me find the correct information, could you please clarify if there is a possibility of typos in the major name, or provide any other details about the students you are looking for?

2025-09-05 10:18:58,385 - __main__ - INFO - Response: It seems there's no information about students and their departments in the database.  This could be due to a few reasons:

* **No data has been entered yet:** The database might be newly created, or the relevant student and department information hasn't been added.
* **Incorrect data model:** The way the data is structured in the database might not match your expectations.  Perhaps the relationships between students and departments aren't correctly defined.
* **Typographical error:**  There might be a mistake in your query (though I'm assuming the query is correct given it's provided).
* **Data filtering:**  Your query might have unintentionally filtered out all results using conditions.



To fix this, we need to check the database for data entry errors and confirm the data model accurately represents the relationships between students and departments.

2025-09-05 10:47:36,973 - __main__ - INFO - Response: It seems there's no information about departments associated with AASTu in our database.  This could be due to a few reasons:

* **AASTu isn't in the database:**  The name might be misspelled, or the information about AASTu may not have been added yet.
* **No department information exists:**  It's possible that AASTu doesn't have departments listed in the way our data is structured.
* **Data is incomplete:**  The database might be missing department information for AASTu, even if it exists in other records.

To help me find the answer, could you double-check the spelling of "AASTu" and provide more context about what kind of organization it is?  This would help me refine my search.
